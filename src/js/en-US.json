For example, many people would be surprised to know that the Bitcoin network cannot handle more than 7 transactions/sec and the Ethereum network only offers a slight improvement of 25 transactions/sec. Many companies continue to investigate blockchain, often on a one-off basis trying to improve performance. Many companies are also realizing the learning curve is nearly vertical for development teams, and with several, recent, high profile hacks, there is an element of uncertainty about security."

To that end, we have implemented cutting-edge protocols and security measures that protect user data from external attacks. We do this by utilizing the blockchain's innately robust security and coupling it with some of our own proprietary security measures to deliver excellent protection against external threats."

This makes building, deploying and running best-of-breed blockchain applications “Twilio-easy” for developers who have no prior blockchain experience. Applications can be configured to leverage existing networks, coalesce transactions into batches dramatically reducing costs, and new private networks can be configured via the UI and deployed to on-premise or public cloud infrastructure."

We have solved the barrier to entry challenge by doing most of the heavy lifting through our interface. Many of the most complicated aspects of smart contract deployment have been reduced to 'point and click' while others might be a slightly more complex process of copy / paste. If you can breathe and write code at the same time, you're going to love what we have to offer."
